        <h2>Dictionary App</h2>
        <p>
          My most recent project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API and React.
          Search for any word and receive the definition, phonetics, examples
          and even pictures in return.
        </p>
        <h2>Weather App</h2>
        <p>
          I first made a working Weather App after learning advanced JavaScript,
          advanced HTML and advanced CSS, as well as using an API. It was then
          remade using React. Search for a city and receive a real-time forecast
          for that area.{" "}

        <h2>Massage Therapy App</h2>
        <p>
          This was the first basic webpage I made with SheCodes using HTML, CSS,
          and JavaScript.
